**What is RoboCode?**
RoboCode (Tank Royale) is a programming game where your code is the tank. You write Java programs that control tanks in a deterministic, turn-based arena, making real-time decisions about movement, aiming, and firing.

**How does it work?**
Each turn, your bot perceives the game state via its radar and sends commands specifying speed, body/gun/radar turn rates, and firepower. Your program decides how to move, aim, and fire based on what it detects.

**What's the goal?**
Outlast all other tanks in the arena. Destroy opponents with well-aimed shots while dodging incoming fire. The last tank standing wins the battle.

**What makes it challenging?**
Success requires balancing movement, targeting, and radar control. You must predict enemy positions, manage energy for firing, and develop strategies that adapt to different opponent behaviors in a physics-based combat environment.
